## ✨ Why You'll Love Privox

- **Beautiful & Simple**: A clean, modern design that is easy to read and stays out of your way.
- **Speaks Your Language**: Intelligent support for English, Cantonese, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Hindi, Spanish, Arabic, and more.
- **Writes Like You**: Choose a "Persona" (like a Professional Writer or an Engineer) to match your writing style perfectly.
- **Forget Grammar Stress**: Privox automatically fixes spelling, grammar, and even removes those "uh" and "um" moments while you talk.
- **One-Key Magic**: Just tap your chosen hotkey to start talking and tap it again when you're done. Privox does the typing for you.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Installation

1. Download **Privox.exe** from our [Releases](https://github.com/markyip/Privox/releases) page.
2. Run the program and follow the simple on-screen instructions.
3. On your first run, Privox will take a few minutes to set up its "AI Brains"—then you're ready to go!

### 2. How to Use

- **Tap your hotkey** (default: `F8`): The app starts listening (you'll see a small animation in your taskbar).
- **Just Talk**: Speak naturally, as if you were talking to a friend.
- **Tap your hotkey again**: Stop talking and watch your words appear on the screen, perfectly polished!

> [!TIP]
> **Your Hotkey, Your Way**: Don't like `F8`? You can change it to any key or combination (like `Ctrl+Shift+Space`) in **Settings**. Open Settings by right-clicking the Privox icon in your taskbar.

## ⚙️ Simple Controls

You don't need to be a computer expert to customize Privox. Just right-click the **Privox icon** near your clock (the system tray):

- **Settings**: Change your hotkey, your writing style, or which language you want to use.
- **Run at Startup**: Have Privox ready for you as soon as you turn on your computer.

## 🖥️ What You Need

- **Windows 10 or 11**.
- **A bit of space**: About **15GB** of space for the high-quality AI models.
- **Modern Hardware**: Works best on computers with an NVIDIA graphics card, but also runs on most modern desktop and laptop PCs.

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- **Very short sentences may not be refined**: To prevent hallucination, Privox will skip AI grammar correction if your spoken input is very short (roughly a few words). The original transcription will be typed out as-is. This is a deliberate safety measure to ensure quality output.
- **Mixed-language sentences are not supported**: Privox works best when you speak in a single language per recording. Mixing two languages within the same sentence (e.g., switching between English and Cantonese mid-sentence) may produce unexpected results.

## 🗺️ What's Coming

We're actively working on making Privox even better:

- **🍎 Mac Version**: A native macOS version is currently in development.
- **♿ Accessibility Version**: A dedicated high-contrast, screen-reader-friendly version is under active development for users with accessibility needs.

## 📄 A Note on Usage

Privox is free for your **Personal & Research use**. Commercial or business use is not allowed without permission. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for more details.
