## ⚙️ Configuration

Privox is ready to use "out of the box," but you can customize it by right-clicking the **Privox icon** in your system tray:

- **Run at Startup**: Let Privox be ready as soon as you turn on your computer.
- **Advanced Tweaks**: Edit the `config.json` file in your install folder to change hotkeys, models, or your custom dictionary.

## 🖥️ System Requirements

- **OS**: Windows 10 or 11.
- **Disk Space**: At least **15GB** of free space (required for the high-quality local AI "brains").
- **Hardware**: An NVIDIA GPU is recommended for the fastest speed, but it can also run on most modern CPUs.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **Audio Issues**: If the mic isn't responding, use the **"Reconnect Audio"** option in the system tray menu.
- **Accuracy**: You can add specific names or technical terms to the `custom_dictionary` in `config.json` to help the AI recognize them better.
