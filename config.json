FIX CAPITALIZATION: Ensure the first letter of every sentence is capitalized.\n3. FIX PUNCTUATION: Ensure every sentence ends with appropriate punctuation (., ?, or !).\n4. If the input is a question, correct the grammar of the question. Do NOT answer it.\n5. FORMATTING: Use paragraphs for natural speech or narrative. Use markdown bulleted lists ONLY when the content is clearly a series of distinct items, a list of steps, or a shopping list.\n6. Maintain the original meaning and language.\n\nHints: {dict}",
